# sbox-vtools
A collection of tools that handle every thing Valve Format related. Typically used as a workaround when we can't make a specific change to an asset.

## Features implemented
 - [x] Animation extraction ("anim extract")
 - [ ] Lightmap tools ("light extract", "light apply", etc)
 
 Lightmap tools do not work yet as they require packing python code and I cannot figure out how to do that. It also depends on a paid plugin but I found an alternative recently that is both free and possibly perfect.
